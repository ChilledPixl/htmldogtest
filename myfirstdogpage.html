        <h1>My first web page</h1>

        <h2>What is this site?</h2>
        
        <p>According to this HTML Dog website, this is my first web page.<br>
            Well, it actually <em>isn't</em> but I'm just copying the tutorial, 
            so it's okay.</p>

        <h2>Why learn this?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>To learn HTML</li>
                <li>To show off</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To my future (hopefully) boss</li>
                        <li>To my friends</li>
                        <li>To my keyboard. <em>Clack, clack, clack</em></li>
                        <li>To the man who said I was too good for my previous job. Thanks, man!</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Because my computer deserves some HTML love. She's a good computer.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>When learning, I like to shove on some shuffled music, either through<br>
        Spotify or YouTube. This ranges from pop to EDM to rock and back to Michael<br>
        Buble, as he deserves his own genre, of course. I also have <a href="https://youtu.be/x5S0lv9DFi4">Nep Nep remixes</a>.</p>
        
        <p id="ending">You're very welcome.</p>
